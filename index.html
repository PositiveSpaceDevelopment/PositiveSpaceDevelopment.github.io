<a id="Education:" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education:</h3>
<p>Lets first start off by relating it to our own app, Grupr. Grupr will use a friend recommendation 
algorithm in order to suggest certain people that utilize the app that are similar to you. The similarities could be a whole range of things, from living in the same hometown, to working in the same group together.</p>
<p>For example, if Sammy and Sally worked in a group together, and Sammy and Johnny worked in a group together, the algorithm would realize there is a mutual friend, Sammy, that both Johnny and Sally have, thus adding each others names to the friend recommendation list.</p>

<a id="How might each app archetype utilize a recommendation algorithm?" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Nutrition</h3>
<p>Another question could be with how the nutrition group that is doing a recipe creation application could utilize a friend recommendation algorithm?</p>
<p>Good question, while they don’t necessarily have friends on their app, they could instead use the algorithm to relate certain ingredients together, and thus instead of the algorithm working on mutual friends, it would be deciding pairings based off mutual ingredients.</p>
<p>For example, say that someone utilizes carrots as a side dish in a recipe, then perhaps the next time they log in to find a new recipe, the recipe recommender could output the most commonly made recipe with carrots.  Then possibly the person wouldn’t even have to put what ingredients they have because the first recipe they saw included ingredients they already had. </p>

<a id="How might each app archetype utilize a recommendation algorithm?" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fitness</h3>
<p>How might a group fitness app utilize a friend finding algorithm? It would be fairly similar to the education friend recommender. </p>
<p>The example in our section would allow for friends to challenge their friends with certain workouts, as well as challenge other groups that they connect with. They could utilize this algorithm to find common connections between both groups and people, and thus they would be able to suggest a number of friends that are at a similar fitness level or in a similar group type.</p>


<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Let us begin by creating a mini Facebook that we will use to demonstrate how a friend recommendation algorithm will work.</h3>

<code>CREATE DATABASE facebook;</code> <p>(Use lowercase f!)</p>
<code> USE facebook;</code>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Now we want to create a table of the members that are going to be utilizing our site</h3>

<code>CREATE TABLE Members ( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
name VARCHAR(60), 
city VARCHAR(60), 
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
</code>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Next we are going to input the people that will be utilizing our application</h3>

<code>INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('andrew terra', 'sacramento');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('ross miller', 'los angeles');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('henry warren', 'minneapolis');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('gabe leyva', 'salem');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('tyler jones', 'tyler');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('jordan vallee', 'sacramento');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('kirk presley', 'memphis');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('byington rhea', 'memphis');<br>
INSERT INTO Members (name, city) values ('mason clark', 'boston');<br>
</code>


<h3>
Now we need to create a table that will hold all of the friendships</h3>

<code>CREATE TABLE Friends (
user      VARCHAR(60), 
friend    VARCHAR(60)
);
</code>


<h3>
Now we need to input our beginning friendships into said table</h3>

<code>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('andrew terra', 'henry warren'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('andrew terra', 'ross miller'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('andrew terra', 'gabe leyva'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('ross miller', 'tyler jones'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('ross miller', 'jordan vallee'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('henry warren', 'jordan vallee'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('henry warren', 'kirk presley'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('gabe leyva', 'byington rhea'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('gabe leyva', 'jordan vallee'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('tyler jones', 'mason clark'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('jordan vallee', 'mason clark'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('kirk presley', 'mason clark'); <br>
  INSERT INTO Friends (user, friend) Values ('byington rhea', 'mason clark'); <br>
</code>

<p>Let's make sure that we have the correct information in our tables, below you can see the SELECT * from 
the tables in the database, when you do these sql queries you should see similar results. </p>

<code>SELECT * FROM Members;
</code>
