<a id="Education:" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education:</h3>
<p>Lets first start off by relating it to our own app, Grupr. Grupr will use a friend recommendation 
algorithm in order to suggest certain people that utilize the app that are similar to you. The similarities could be a whole range of things, from living in the same hometown, to working in the same group together.</p>
<p>For example, if Sammy and Sally worked in a group together, and Sammy and Johnny worked in a group together, the algorithm would realize there is a mutual friend, Sammy, that both Johnny and Sally have, thus adding each others names to the friend recommendation list.</p>

<a id="How might each app archetype utilize a recommendation algorithm?" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Nutrition</h3>
<p>Another question could be with how the nutrition group that is doing a recipe creation application could utilize a friend recommendation algorithm?</p>
<p>Good question, while they don’t necessarily have friends on their app, they could instead use the algorithm to relate certain ingredients together, and thus instead of the algorithm working on mutual friends, it would be deciding pairings based off mutual ingredients.</p>
<p>For example, say that someone utilizes carrots as a side dish in a recipe, then perhaps the next time they log in to find a new recipe, the recipe recommender could output the most commonly made recipe with carrots.  Then possibly the person wouldn’t even have to put what ingredients they have because the first recipe they saw included ingredients they already had. </p>

<a id="How might each app archetype utilize a recommendation algorithm?" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fitness</h3>
<p>How might a group fitness app utilize a friend finding algorithm? It would be fairly similar to the education friend recommender. </p>
<p>The example in our section would allow for friends to challenge their friends with certain workouts, as well as challenge other groups that they connect with. They could utilize this algorithm to find common connections between both groups and people, and thus they would be able to suggest a number of friends that are at a similar fitness level or in a similar group type.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular 
HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
